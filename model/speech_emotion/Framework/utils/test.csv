0.0,119.6,getting very bored and that's not a frequent thing because bird and is quite horrible emotion to be also I've had it wasn't very good in the last 24-hours I think of the weather's going to be rubbish there's no engines day and I'm just fed up you know what things have you missed most you know what I don't I just woke up this morning this is true that has never been a bit of a panic attack but it's because I'm bored and I get it I don't know is it because I'm not outside because it's gonna be in it if you ask me one thing I don't know everything's alright I suppose a mess the fact that there's no you can't plan you can think I will go at such a PACE that the weekend lol as these that somebody tomorrow you just in the house,0.9484513401985168,0
0.0,179.6,think it's that how to define because nothing horrible is happening and not even here but it's just 5 weeks in and my cabin fever you think it's had a negative impact on you or people close to you I think we've all enjoyed a four or five a genuinely think we're you know calm down slow pace of life I think it's now 5 weeks in or are getting their key holiday weekend station just leaving nothing has been done with exercises and then you know that that's starting to everyone's just that mean if you go on holiday you go for a couple of weeks don't you answer this but I've had enough when you get stuck into something back to the gym,0.9402753710746765,0
0.0,239.6,property meetings and not wearing a tracksuit no I think it's just I think the impact of being the length of each day it's been ok but put that on with no break all into one go 5 weeks so far and it's not like weekend anything changes it's just exactly the same isn't it that's the hardest thing so has the current situation made you know where is an anxious and it has a bit because there was a few like financial things I've actually started them out today have been online but things aren't so can you try and make a phone call their call centres down there so you know we'll get back to you know when does get back to you so you are a bit wondering just,0.9518031477928162,0
0.0,299.7,it was probably a storm in a teacup a few things happen when was simple and then made another chat with that money at the moment they're called Spencer's shop end up getting double the product that I don't want to send them but it doesn't it because you can't contact anybody so I thinking that mate probably yes it's just everything seems so don't worry about going to the shop not been able to get food or the wider economy having a negative impact I think the way I think some shops like cafes my friends little cafe that we really like going to I don't know whether this year we've I think I'll husband is working but it's things like that I know there's loads of little places,0.9291293025016785,0
0.0,359.6,I'll be sad but it's not quite enjoy going shopping I actually like that but there's been a few times where you been quite like I would never be like that in the supermarket so I think we're like we're not we're ok but no one's that far away if if there is something are the shop became Fuller I think we could quite easily get into vows that we wouldn't get into I think it's a knife edge like America I'm aware like it I don't run down to nothing I go when I've got like maybe already have got two bottles of milk but I want this bed and the phone,0.945890486240387,0
0.0,419.6,don't get that what if I get there there's a massive queue everyone's been in a bit hostile and you filled is a and protecting of the food which I never worked before in that way more insecure as a pearls do you think there's going to be a negative impact on the economy as a whole in the future of course is that the government According lo I mean that money is just almost numbers bear scale it's not individually I think we're going to be somewhat she has a lot of all that quantitative easing everybody do the day somebody must have problems but I think individual it seems to be,0.9477365016937256,0
0.0,479.4,and we're done with the economy because of brexit as well but he seems to calm it says it's almost like it's going to be ok the companies that may be needed to be structure will do I think they get cash does that to be due it will be a massive shake up almost feels like they wanted to clear the decks and I'm not 100% convinced that it's all going to be negative but it's all going to be different but sometimes need to clear out the oh don't you I feel like it might be a fresh start and only based on how they are pleasing things they're not as worried if they should be so I'm guessing it obviously we're not going to get going to be interesting I think I'm the home maybe 18 months,0.9395806789398193,0
0.0,539.4,think it'll be quite strong position but some people individually will suffer probably small businesses which is unfortunate I think the wider economy 2 metre itself but I think it would just explode once the restrictions are lifted so I'm going to move on to things that might have made you feel annoyed or irritated about the current situation what's the main things that made you feel angry well it is about this and it stings like and no let the police but now they're watching citizens of everywhere so don't you always hear that there's no police but they can find police to watch it that surprised me I don't,0.938005268573761,0
0.0,598.0,how quickly the police have moved into that role it's a little bit intimidating that they so better it they've got the number so I don't like that at all what else has been moaning about the other day the fact that you can't you can't go and have a picnic custom babe but you can't you outside of sleep cause we proceeded dick slapping on the bridge so you can do things like that it doesn't it's not sensible it's like ninja you can do that don't do that but don't meet your friends in the park even if it's next to the stranger now because that food shopping if you're going to have rules follow them through this should make sense because at the moment you actually just stay awake because you've got to do something and some of them might have a difference if I want to go for a walk in the sunshine on my own and I want to sit down,0.9470794200897217,0
0.0,659.5,why should I not do that because that's part of having a picnic on the moving people that long but you kept but you've not said it's online deliveries of food only so I can go and get a coffee I can't go on like sit in the Parkinson even out Sunshines better for you and fresh air is supposed to kill viruses that starting to Great actually and I don't like the fact that there's a lot of people on Facebook posting pictures and saying when I was on my work today oh there's loads of people in my class today and I only went to see if anyone else is there and all the people there but I wasn't there because I was just checking if you bye I'm going to start on sending you know that that attitude I know everyone out that there's a lot does a few people that I'm going to struggle to be,0.9360537528991699,0
0.0,719.1,because they've shown that the IC and authoritarian but as you know what you know and just put you in charge of police and everyone else is doing it I think that there's a lot of that it's surprising how much of that the population levels community spirit and I'm some levels shopping looking what you doing at your window and things like that out like that do you think the government's handle this whole situation well or not I think probably am I right with what they've done but I think they probably should have followed the Swedish model I think Boris had it right at the start,0.9525313377380371,0
0.0,778.6,because we need an out and we haven't got the you haven't gotten out you know where is different to understand that mostly single households currently date more spread out the population of had a few things that was saying it isn't quite there but they've maintained thing I think it was on the right track and then it was Imperial College I believe that released that you pull and bear modelling for Sweden is true to be completely wrong you know you don't know because it's a model but one feel like that data and then just massively overreacted and I like what she planned now because you've now got potentially a team you've chosen a path with no end where is the Swedish of chosen after me what to do in so I feel like this been fairly competent but I don't think this I think we followed the wrong path,0.9426071643829346,0
0.0,839.4,play and then changed from pressure and is currently on the wrong however he's managing the path quite well but let's see where we go from here spectacular out the bag is not really got a way of getting us out of this past week so I'm going Dennis by asking you about what you going to do to celebrate when lockdown is finished or whether anything particularly amusing ok this come out of being locked I mean it's going to be a Stranger things I think it's going to be saved so we have on the night before lockdown we did and said don't do and we did go to the Japanese and I had a lovely meal and the pubs were so like that's going to be weird because that's all done but we said,0.9433067440986633,0
0.0,899.4,allowed to be going back in Japanese I so much want the bento box the Japanese bento box at the whole thing is I didn't even read a drop then we gonna go straight back to there so that's why and that's a good thing because the best ones out of open have it isn't so that's not depending on what celebrate because it'll probably be like such an ease great but that's our little thing to say the minute the Japanese is back hope and will think ok well maybe not getting back on track so there is that I suppose it's been funny that instead of being part only like a bit in the weekend mostly is now hear that have six at the seven nights and you know that's been funny had a few little bit but I think,0.9421771764755249,0
